Using X11 with the HPC cluster
=================================


**What is X11?**

X11 is a way to forward graphical programs over SSH. This allows you to remotely start graphical software from a remote terminal session.
In order to use X11, software must be installed. For Mac we recommend `XQuartz <https://www.xquartz.org/>`_. For Windows we recommend using `Putty <https://putty.org/index.html>`_. for ssh and `VcXsrv <https://vcxsrv.com/>`_. for X11.




**How to use X11 to run graphical software over ssh?**

#. Make sure an X11 program is installed and running on your computer.
#. Ssh into the cluster with the -YC command line option like so: ssh username@cryoemcluster.biochem.wisc.edu -YC
#. Enter the command to run the software.
