When you open Jupyter Notebook you will be presented with your home directory. 
To start a new notebook click the New dropdown near the top right of the screen. Then select the type of notebook you'd like to start. We currently support Python 3 notebooks.

A new untitled notebook will be started. You can change the notebook name by clicking the name at the top of the page. This will bring up a modal for changing the notebook name. To start using the notebook, click in the first cell and type your code. To run your code press Shift + Enter or click the play button on the top menu bar.
