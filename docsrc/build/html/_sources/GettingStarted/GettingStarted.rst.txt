Getting Started with the HPC Cluster
=====================================


This document describes steps to get started with the HPC cluster.

1. Request access to the cluster here: https://explore.wisc.edu/cryoem_hpc_access_request

2. Review the cluster policies here: https://kb.wisc.edu/cryoem/internal/133680

3. You will receive an e-mail when your cluster account is created. You must be connected to the biochem vpn network (biochem.vpn.wisc.edu) to access the cluster. Please test access by running the following command while connected to the vpn:

ssh yourUser@wisc.edu@clusterlogin2.biochem.wisc.edu -YC     

OR

ssh yourUser@wisc.edu@cryoemcluster.biochem.wisc.edu -YC

4. Transfer data to the cluster using Globus. Your data should be transferred to the UW-Madison Cryo-EM Research Center Data collection.

Please contact Jennifer Scheuren at jfscheuren@wisc.edu for any cluster questions or issues.
