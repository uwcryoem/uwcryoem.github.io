Accessing machines with interactive desktop
=============================================

Open OnDemand provides desktop access so that users can run graphics-based applications on the cluster. To use interactive desktop click on Interactive Apps > Desktop Access or click the Desktop Access icon on the main page. This will initialize an interactive desktop session. When the session is ready, it will display as running and you can click the Launch Desktop Access link to view the desktop in the browser.




***Closing a session***

To exit an interactive desktop session, click your username in the upper right of the desktop then click Log Out. A window will pop up, click Log Out on that window as well.



***Extending a session***

By default interactive desktop sessions last for 100 hours or until the session is closed by the user logging out. If you need additional time for a session, please send an e-mail to jfscheuren@wisc.edu as early as possible.
